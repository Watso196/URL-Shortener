# URL-Shortener
A small JavaScript URL shortening/lengthening application to practice working with APIs.

This project was built with vanilla JavaScript and Google's URL API as a way to practice interacting with a REST API interface.

**NOTICE**
The API originally used to create this app is now deprecated. Until I get around to replacing the API, the app will not function as expected.
